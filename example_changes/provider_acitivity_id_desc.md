# Example Standard Change

## Current Rule

The description of [provider-org/provider-activity-id](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction/provider-org/) says:

If incoming funds are being provided from the budget of another activity that is reported to IATI, it if STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that this should record the provider's unique IATI activity identifier for that activity.


## Proposed Change

That “it if” is changed to “it is”.

## Rationale

This is clearly a mistake during the drafting of the schema, which we want to correct. 

## Impact

Improved comprehensibility of the IATI schema; improved ease of translation. 

No negative impacts are anticipated as this doesn’t change the meaning of the description.
