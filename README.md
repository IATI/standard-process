# IATI standard processes

This is where we discuss, develop and improve the processes used
to govern the [IATI data standard](https://iatistandard.org/).
This repository is used by the Standard Stewardship Working Group,
but data publishers and users from the wider community are also
welcome to contribute.

## How to get involved

Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/IATI/standard-process/discussions)
tab to get involved in conversations or post your own thoughts.

Open [an issue](https://github.com/IATI/standard-process/issues) if you have
a specific problem that needs fixing. Remember to check if anyone else has
already opened an issue on the same topic before.
